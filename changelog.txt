[Integration] - Added integration with FramedBlocks content added in 1.19.2 and 1.20.1
Removed:
- Removed legacy cannon plume appearance client config, can now only turn plumes on or off in clientside config
- Removed single-projectile shrapnel, grapeshot, and fluid blob entities
Changed:
- Updated Ritchie's Projectile Library dependency to 2.0.0
 - Improved chunkloading performance
 - Replaced PreciseProjectile interface with tag #ritchiesprojectilelib:precise_motion
 - Changed screen shake to use Ritchies Projectile Library code rather than Create Big Cannons code
- Separated smoke shell smoke particle (createbigcannons:smoke_shell_smoke) from cannon smoke particle (createbigcannons:cannon_smoke)
 - Both still use the same textures and particle definition by default
- Changed how big cannon plumes look
- Changed description of some ponder categories
- Rework cannon plume to use better particles
- Changed default cannon mount angle goggle display precision from 1 to 2 digits
- Improved cannon heating ponder information to clarify layering
- Improved sound effects of cannon firing
- Tweaked speed and entity damage attributes of Drop Mortar Shell
- Tweaked shrapnel spread and shrapnel damage values of Shrapnel Shell
- Tweaked grapeshot spread and grapeshot damage values of Bag of Grapeshot
- Changed all shrapnel projectiles to a single projectile burst entity to reduce entity count
 - Includes: Shrapnel Shell, Bag of Grapeshot, Fluid Shell, and Flak Autocannon Round
 - Harder to create chunkbans with new system
 [Addons, integration] - Fluid Blob effects registry has been changed to work with Fluid Blob bursts rather than single Fluid Blobs. This will break already existing integration.
- Separated flak burst from shrapnel burst
- Changed screen shake delay to be on client
[Addons, integration] - Added ability to register multiple fluid blob effect handlers for a single fluid type
- Refactor projectile properties to be less inheritance-based (BREAKING)
 - New approach involves projectile-specific serializers that projectiles must reference instead of getting wildcard
 - This will break existing serializers and retrieval of properties
 - Some config files will be broken
  - All fields that are either "explosion_power" or "explosive_power" are now "explosive_power"
- Rework drag kinematics to ease factoring in dimensional density
 - All projectiles are affected
 - Previously, the drag equation was { vel' = vel * drag * dimensional density }
 - The drag equation is now { vel' = vel - vel * vel * drag * dimensional density }
 - Changed default drag values of big cannon and autocannon projectiles to 0.001 by default
 - Changed default drag values of projectile burst sub-projectiles to 0 by default
- Tweaked Mortar Stone to be able to handle equivalent of 3 Powder Charges, up from 1 Powder Charge
- Improved in-world effects of fluid blob fluids
 - Added ability for fluid blob to affect entities in-flight
 - Water-filled Fluid Blob harms entities sensitive to water and douses entities
 - Lava-filled fluid blob now lights certain blocks, opposite to water's effects
 - Potion-filled Fluid Blob applies its effect to entities while in flight
- Improved quick firing breech opening effects
 - Add more particles on opening and give them a bit of velocity
 - Add a short pickup delay for ejected items, can be configured on server
 - Can configure between item going directly into inventory and dropping item, default latter

- Rework penetration and bouncing (BREAKING)
 - Separate hardness and toughness (default: hardness == 1, toughness == blast resistance)
  - JSONs must be rewritten
 - Most projectiles now have additional config fields "penetration", "toughness", and "deflection"
 - Projectiles now shatter if block hardness - projectile penetration > projectile toughness, prevents some fuzes from detonating
 - Renamed Resistance Inspection Tool to Block Armor Inspection Tool
 - Block Armor Inspection Tool now displays info in a more elegant form similar to goggles
 - Block Armor Inspection Tool also displays information on hovered blocks in the inventory
- Improved terminal projectile trajectory appearance on clientside

- Rebalanced some block armor values
- Rebalanced autocannons to be more accurate
