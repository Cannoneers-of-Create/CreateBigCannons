5.5.0

"messi messi messi immens messi encara messi encara messi encara messi"

Create Big Cannons 5.5.0, with many bug fixes and QoL changes, as well as an aesthetic overhaul to many of the visual and sound effects.
Comes with version formatting change, but gameplay changes are otherwise not major.

Added:
- Added some config options to use subheadings in Create config screen
- Added durability and fuze position tooltip to Impact Fuze and Delayed Impact Fuze
- Added config to switch between cannon trail styles
- Added cannon trail particle
 - By default appears the same as campfire smoke
 - Particle texture definition can be changed
- Added new style for autocannon plumes (createbigcannons:autocannon_plume) and drop mortar plumes (createbigcannons:drop_mortar_plume) separate from big cannon plume (createbigcannons:big_cannon_plume)
 - Added separate clientside visibility config options for these plumes
- Added Drop Mortar Shell and Smoke Shell to "Fuzing Munitions" ponder
- Added Drop Mortar Shell, Fluid Shell, and Smoke Shell to Munitions ponder tag
- Added Cannon Loads ponder to Big Cartridge
- Added item tooltips for Smoke Shell
- Added contained fluid tooltip for Fluid Shell item
- Added fuze tooltips for fuzed big cannon munitions
- Added filled Big Cartridge to creative search tab
- Added separate config for screen shake intensity
- Added ability to add Tracer Tips to big cannon projectiles
 - Added config to make all big cannon projectiles have tracers regardless if they have tracers, where applicable
 - Solid Shot and AP Shot now have block entities to allow tracer placement. Blocks missing them may need to be replaced.
- Added screen shake config options
 - Screen shake intensity (client)
 - Screen shake restitution (client)
 - Screen shake decay (client)
 - Screen shake range (server)
 - Screen shake power (server)
 - Screen shake propagation speed (server)
  - The faster it is, the less delay there is for players at a distance
- Added cannon mount angle goggle display config options
 - Added config for angle precision; ranges from 0 to 4 digits
 - Added config for yaw display range; can either be -180 to +180 degrees or 0 to +360 degrees, defaults to the latter
- Added pick block functionality to Cannon Carriage entity (yields its item)
- Added flak and shrapnel burst cloud effects
 - Has appearance and visibility client config options
 - Amount of particles can also be configured in the shrapnel
- Added new burst sounds for flak and shrapnel
- Added config for different types of big cannon projectile smoke trail: Long, Short, and No Trail
- Added smoke trails to autocannon projectiles
 - Has config for type of trail: Long, Short, and No Trail
- Added "ignores_invulnerability" field to projectiles, ignoring projectile invulnerability
 - The old "ignores_entity_armor" field now only affects if entity armor is bypassed, not invulnerability
 - By default, all CBC projectiles ignore invulnerability, but differ in if they bypass armor
Removed:
- Removed legacy cannon plume appearance client config, can now only turn plumes on or off in clientside config
- Removed single-projectile shrapnel, grapeshot, and fluid blob entities
Changed:
- Updated Ritchie's Projectile Library dependency to 2.0.0
 - Improved chunkloading performance
 - Replaced PreciseProjectile interface with tag #ritchiesprojectilelib:precise_motion
 - Changed screen shake to use Ritchies Projectile Library code rather than Create Big Cannons code
- Separated smoke shell smoke particle (createbigcannons:smoke_shell_smoke) from cannon smoke particle (createbigcannons:cannon_smoke)
 - Both still use the same textures and particle definition by default
- Changed how big cannon plumes look
- Changed description of some ponder categories
- Rework cannon plume to use better particles
- Changed default cannon mount angle goggle display precision from 1 to 2 digits
- Improved cannon heating ponder information to clarify layering
- Improved sound effects of cannon firing
- Tweaked speed and entity damage attributes of Drop Mortar Shell
- Tweaked shrapnel spread and shrapnel damage values of Shrapnel Shell
- Tweaked grapeshot spread and grapeshot damage values of Bag of Grapeshot
- Changed all shrapnel projectiles to a single projectile burst entity to reduce entity count
 - Includes: Shrapnel Shell, Bag of Grapeshot, Fluid Shell, and Flak Autocannon Round
 - Harder to create chunkbans with new system
 [Addons, integration] - Fluid Blob effects registry has been changed to work with Fluid Blob bursts rather than single Fluid Blobs. This will break already existing integration.
- Separated flak burst from shrapnel burst
- Refactor projectile properties to be less inheritance-based (BREAKING)
 - New approach involves projectile-specific serializers that projectiles must reference instead of getting wildcard
 - This will break existing serializers and retrieval of properties
 - Some config files will be broken
  - All fields that are either "explosion_power" or "explosive_power" are now "explosive_power"
- Rework drag kinematics to ease factoring in dimensional density
 - All projectiles are affected
 - Previously, the drag equation was { vel' = vel * drag * dimensional density }
 - The drag equation is now { vel' = vel - vel * vel * drag * dimensional density }
 - Changed default drag values of big cannon and autocannon projectiles to 0.001 by default
 - Changed default drag values of projectile burst sub-projectiles to 0 by default
Fixed:
- Fixed invalid cannon propellant combinations due to spelling mistake in data pack folder name
- Fixed cannon loader pushing without head
- Fixed lag from cannon being tested during explosion, courtesy of Endalion
- Fixed Disable All Failures config option not disabling squibbing
- Fixed manual autocannons breaking on tick after squib
- Fixed Create Big Cannons projectiles exceeding 10 m/gt (200 m/gt) losing their velocity when loaded
- Fixed Smoke Shell and Drop Mortar Shell being invalid blocks for createbigcannons:fuzed_block block entity
- Fixed Cannon Carriage rotation info tooltip and syncing
- Fixed Disable All Failures applying to big cannon projectiles with 0 cannon power
- Fixed schematics not saving data of many blocks by adding #create:safe_nbt
- Fixed potential crash on cannon failure in some Create Big Cannons contraption code
- Fixed /gamerule doTileDrops false not applying to Create Big Cannons pole contraptions
- Fixed small charge projectiles not emitting cannon smoke
